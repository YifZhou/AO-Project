#Coronagraph Slides

## Introduction
**Slide 1.** the concept of coronagraph    
**Slide 2.** types of coronagraph    
**Slide 3.** coronagraph and exoplanet observation    
**Slide 4-5.** How to evaluate and optimize a coronagraph    
1. in Astronomical point of view:    
2. in Optical point of view:   

**Slide 6.** Outlines of our project    
1. what aspects of coronagraph we choose    
2. how do those aspects relate to exoplanet study.

## Our project
### coronagraph in AO Sim 2    
**Slide7?.** different realizations of coronagraph in Fourier Optics
**Slide8.** How to build a coronagraph in AO Sim 2
**Slide9.** Simulate HR8799 system with AO Sim 2 to demonstrate how Coronagraph work in exoplanet study. (Plot 1)

### AO and Coronagraph
>this basically is to answer the question, how well the wave front error correction of the AO needs to be so that a coronagraph device can start to work.     
    
    
**Slide 10.** RMS wavefront error vs. Contrast or RMS wavefront error with inner working angle
In direct imaging exoplanet observation, contrast is the ratio of the flux coming from the faint planet and that of the host star. The contrast is the most important factor in direct imaging an exoplanet.     
We can generate different wavefront error in AO Sim2 and see when the coronagraph start to improve imaging the planet.

**Slide 11.?** A movie here maybe?    
We could generate a bunch of simulated images in the procedure described in *Slide 9*, we can make a movie out of it to demonstrate comparison the different changes of images as a function of rms with and without a coronagraph.

### coronagraph and wavelength
**Slide 12-13** Similar to *Slide 9-10* to generate a coronagraph that is optimized, e.g. for wavelength of 1 micron and demonstrate the change of its behavior in other wavelengths

### coronagraph and Jittering of the telescope*    
the pointing of the telescope cannot be perfect during a long exposure. We could analyze what is the maximize amplitude of jittering of the telescope that a coronagraph can still work.

*****
*Above three topics on coronagraph is what I am thinking about now. I suggest we can finalize on two topics by this weekend.*
